# ReinforcementLearning
<b>Some of my reinforcement learning experimentations.</b>
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>GridWorld - the agent tries to find the fastest way to the goal</li>
<li>GridWorld_ApproximateQLearning - the agent also tries to find the fastest
way to the goal of a more complex map but the approach uses features to
decide on the next action instead of the whole map layout.</li>
<li>PacMan - the pacman agent tries to eat all the cheese on the map. 
You can load different maps and draw your own.</li>
<li>ReinforcementLearning - the (fast and poorly written) library i wrote,
just to be able to quickly experiment with reinforcement.</li>
</ul>
